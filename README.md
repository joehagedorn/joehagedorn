- 👋 Hi, I’m @joehagedorn
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamental processes of learning that benefit vulnerable communities lacking digital resources.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing solutions that address the question, "How can regenerative agriculture be used to engage students on sustainable product development?"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with makers and other like-minded learning communities.
