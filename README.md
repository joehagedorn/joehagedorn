- 👋 Hi, I’m @joehagedorn
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamental processes of learning that benefit vulnerabile communities lacking digital resources.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing solutions that address the question "How can regenerative agriculture be used to educate students in coding and making towards more fair economies?"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with maker and other like minded learning communities.
