- 👋 Hi, I’m @joehagedorn
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamental processes of learning that may benefit vulnerabile communities lacking digital resources.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on using graph organizational principles to document my general inquiry stated as: "How can regenerative agriculture relate to zero waste supply chains?"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on use of graph domains specified as unique knowledge spaces that fundamentally relate through geospatial reference and time parameters
